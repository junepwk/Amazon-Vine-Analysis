    - There were 94 Vine reviews and 40,471 non-Vine reviews.

- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

    - There were 48 5-stars Vine reviews and 15,663 5-stars non-Vine reviews.
    
- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

    - There were 51.06% 5-stars Vine reviews and 38.70% 5-stars non-Vine reviews.
    
## Summary
Although the number of Vine users are significantly lower, the percentages of 5-stars reviews made by Vine vs non-Vine users indicates there might be some positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Further testing would be required. These testings might include doing an analysis on video games that include both types of users (Vine & non-Vine) and an analysis on which product (or video game company) is most likely to have Vine users.
